# Curfews: are they working?

On October 14 2020 Emmanuel Macron announced a national health emergency due to pressure on ICUs in urban areas. As a result, since midnight Oct 17 2020, 9 métropoles are under curfew from 21h to 06h for a minimum of 4 weeks, possibly extending to 6.

On Oct 16 the good folks at data.gouv.fr/Santé Publique France made a new dataset available to track incidence rates & ICU capacity these & several other metropolitan areas in France. Woohoo, vive la transparence !

The list is fairly short; presumably these are metro areas considered most at risk (read: university towns).

When you play this animation, it's not hard to understand why these metro areas were put under curfew. :rocket:

Because of the 3-day reporting lag, the data still predates the start of the curfew period. But it will be interesting to compare how things evolve in curfew areas. And to see if any other metropoles are moving into the curfew zone.
