# Curfews: why some but not others?

Since Oct 14 France has begun imposing curfews from 21h to 06h. These begun on Oct 17 in 9 metropolitan areas.

<blockquote>On Oct 24, this curfew was extended to 38 additional departments, as well as the departments of the original 9 metropoles.</blockquote>

When you play the animation below, it's clear why these metros in particular were put under curfew.

As the days go by it will be interesting to see the trajectory for the curfew metros compared to non-curfew ones.  And to see if any other metropoles are moving into the curfew zone.
