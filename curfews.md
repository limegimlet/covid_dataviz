# Curfews: why some but not others?

The national health emergency declared on October 14 triggered several new restrictions. 

Most newsworthy: imposing a 21h - 06h curfew on 9 m√©tropoles starting from midnight Oct 17 2020. It's for a minimum of 4 weeks and may be extended to 6 weeks, subject to a vote in the national assembly and senate.

Shortly afterwards, a new dataset became available on data.gouv.fr to track these & several other metropolitan areas. 

When you play the animation below, it's clear why these metros in particular were put under curfew.

As the days go by it will be interesting to see the trajectory for the curfew metros compared to non-curfew ones.  And to see if any other metropoles are moving into the curfew zone.
