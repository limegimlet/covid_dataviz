# Curfews: are they working?

The national health emergency declared on October 14 triggered several new restrictions. Most newsworthy: imposing curfew from 21h to 06h on 9 m√©tropoles for a minimum of 4 weeks from midnight Oct 17 2020. It may be extended to 6 weeks if the vote passes in the national assembly and senate.

Shortly afterwards, a new dataset became available on data.gouv.fr to track incidence rates & ICU capacity in these & several other metropolitan areas. 

When you play the animation below, it's not hard to understand why these metro areas were put under curfew.

As the days go by it will be interesting to see the trajectory for the curfew metros compared to non-curfew ones.  And to see if any other metropoles are moving into the curfew zone.
