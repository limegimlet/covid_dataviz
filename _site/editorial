For the second wave the aim is to keep hospitals open for non-Covid patients and to protect exhausted ICU staff. It's lack of additional trained people, not ventilators or beds that is limiting capacity.

Another other challenge for ICUs is that all regions are being hit at once this time. There is no longer the option to transfer patients to lesser-hit regions as Grand Est and Ile de France did during the first wave.

Nationwide, we are still just barely under that as of Oct 15. However there are departements that are already well above 60% ICU capacity.
