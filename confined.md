# Confinement: the impact so far

Nov 12: We are starting to see modest decreases in incidence rates, but barely any for ICU saturation.

* **The heatmaps below show daily percentage change since Oct 28 2020**, after which France began its second confinement.

* **Departments appear in descending order**: the department with the greatest decrease or increase since confinement began is the first listed.

* Changes in incidence rates are **net of changes in testing rates**.  For clarity, raw % changes for both are shown in the hoverbox.

* Note the color scale to the right of each heatmap: it varies widely for each.

* Also, note that the scale for decreases is far more modest for `rea%` than for increases. **In other words, we've still got a ways to go**.

## Incidence rate decreases

Nov 13: This is the first good sign. The vast majority of departments show decreasing `incid_tous`.

However, even if it's decreasing, there's still a very high number of new infections.

Since inevitably a certain proportion of those infected now will end up in ICU ~7 days from now, it still means stress for hospitals for the foreseeable future.

## ICU saturation decreases

These are modest, and seem to be all rural. It's likely they have few ICU beds so the departure of one or two patients can have a big impact.

## ICU saturation increases

The first row is something of an outlier, with such a giant increase that the still-large increases elsewhere literally pale in comparison.

Also, Deux-SÃ¨vres is the department with the 2nd-lowest number of ICU beds per 100k population: 2.08. For comparison, the highest numbers (in Territoire du Belfort & Paris) are above 17 beds per 100k population.
