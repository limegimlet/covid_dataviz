# Confinement: the impact so far

Nov 12: We are starting to see modest decreases in incidence rates, but barely any for ICU saturation.

* **The heatmaps below show daily percentage change since Oct 28 2020**, after which France began its second confinement.

* **Departments appear in descending order**: the department with the greatest decrease or increase since confinement began is the first listed.

* Changes in incidence rates are **net of changes in testing rates**.  For clarity, raw % changes for both are shown in the hoverbox.

* Note the color scale to the right of each heatmap: it varies widely for each.

* Also, note that the scale for decreases is more modest than that of increases, especially for `rea%`. **In other words, we've still got a ways to go**.

## ICU saturation decreases

These are modest, and seem to be all rural. It's likely they have few ICU beds so the departure of one or two patients can have a big impact.

## ICU saturation increases

The first row is something of an outlier, with such a giant increase that the still-large increases elsewhere literally pale in comparison.

Also, Deux-SÃ¨vres has the 2nd-lowest number of ICU beds per capita: 2.08. (By comparison, the highest numbers are above 17 beds per capita).
