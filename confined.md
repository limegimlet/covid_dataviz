# Confinement: the impact so far

We are starting to see modest decreases in incidence rates for both general population and the elderly.

Not surprisingly, the decreases are unfolding in the same order they increased: first `incid_tous`, followed by `incid_70+`, with `rea%` trailing by a wide margin.

<blockquote><b>Note the scale at right for each heatmap</b>: it varies widely for each. Also, the scale for decreases is more modest than that of increases, especially for `rea%`. In other words, we've got a ways to go still.</blockquote>

## Incidence rate decreases

Interestingly, most of the Ile-de-France departments are at the top. The Nord department (containing Lille) has also seen incidence rate drop quickly.

## Incidence rate increases

It's saddening to see Territoire de Belfort (Mulhouse) at the top: as location of France's first super-spreader event, it's the department with the highest per capita death toll from the first wave.

While case numbers rose over the summer Grand Est and Territoire de Belfort stayed relatively low; I had supposed that the population, as in northern Italy, was so marked by the first wave that it was easier to respect les gestes barri√®res.

## Elderly incidence rate decreases

At the top are mostly rural areas, but Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis make an appearance here too.

## ICU saturation decreases

These are modest, and seem to be all rural. It's likely they have few ICU beds so the departure of one or two patients can have a big impact.

## ICU saturation increases

The first row is something of an outlier, with such a giant increase that the still-large increases elsewhere literally pale in comparison.
